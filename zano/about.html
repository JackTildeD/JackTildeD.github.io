                    Howdy there, you probably know me from my websites online that you likely used to navigate to here. If you were brought to this place by some other means, that&#x2019;s really cool though!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&#x2019;m Zano, aka RunawayDanish. This is my worldbuilding exercise and media roll-out of my science fiction setting known as Zeng Qon. The drama of Zeng Qon as of current is focused on a planet called Zevash, and the consequences of a galactic civilization struggling with maintaining ethics and cultural cohesion as it spreads through the stars -- as well as those effected by that civilization&#x2019;s growth!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zeng Qon isn&#x2019;t an optimistic utopia, but rather a Galaxy more resembling an average game of Stellaris. Ambitious space-faring civilizations step on each others&#x2019; toes, replace or assimilate those less technologically and societally sophisticated than themselves, and good intentions are often used to justify actions unsavory or harmful to others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It&#x2019;s not all doom and gloom though! Skilled leadership of ethical and scientific personnel can help guide the denizens of the Coalition from their own destruction and the needless destruction of others. I hope to inspire in you a confidence and deeper understanding of how societies decide to take action, and what steps we all can play in attempting to steer the ship right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 3 years of pre-planning and idea development, I hope it will be compelling and interesting to you.
                </p>

                            Furaffinity is my primary website of choice. I got my start online really through FA, and the bulk of my fans hail from there as well. As you probably know, I draw a lot of porn. There&#x2019;s porn there.

                            Unlike Furaffinity, my Twitter is trash and is really not followed much. This is probably because I mix my vague ramblings about political happenings with my furry porn which all goes ignored by the Twitter crowd.
